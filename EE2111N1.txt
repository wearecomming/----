Linear systems possess two important properties, namely superposition and 
homogeneity.

A dynamical system is where the current output (or effect variable) depends on past 
inputs (or cause variables). As such, a dynamical system is also referred to as a system 
with memory. 
• On the other hand, a static system is where the current output 
depends only on the current input. It cannot depend on past values 
and, as such, these systems are referred to as systems with no 
memory
• The principle of superposition - this states that the response produced by a combination of 
different inputs is the sum of the individual responses produced by each of the different 
inputs acting alone. In other words, the response of a multi-input linear system can be 
determined by dealing with each input in turn and then adding the results. 
• Homogeneity (or scaling) – this states that if an input u(t) produces and output y(t) then, 
for a linear system, an input ku(t) will produce an output ky(t), where k is a scalar. 

A transfer function (TF) model is the input-output relationship of a system in the Laplace 
Transform space.
A TF is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transforms of the output and input of a system 
for zero initial conditions:
