#The answer of the question3 at P40
<br>
##a

### International System (SI) Units
from the table we can find that the unit of $r$ is meter(m),according to the formula
$
V=\frac{4 {r^3}}{3 \pi}
$
we can find that the unit of $V$ is three to the power of $r$, which means that the unit of $V$ is $m^3$
<br>
according to the table,$m^3$ is  the true answer
### U.S. Customary Units

from the table we can find that the unit of 'r' is feet(ft),according to the formula
$
V=\frac{4 {r^3}}{3 \pi}
$
we can find that the unit of $V$ is three to the power of $r$, which means that the unit of $V$ is ${ft}^3$
<br>
according to the table,${ft}^3$ is  the true answer
##b
according to the fomula,we could find that:
$$
V=\frac{4* 4^3}{3\pi}=\frac{256}{3}\pi \approx 268.08
$$
##c
###inputs
my inputs will be $r$,becuase in the formula, only $V$ and $r$ are unknowns. If $V$ is required, you must enter $r$
###outputs
according to the question,my outputs will be $V$
###algorithm
I will write my code according to the formula
