In the reading, it claims that Peary,a well-konw adventurer,had reached the North Pole on April 7,1909, and there are three arguments which privide strong support for it.
However,the professer disagree with it.
First,the reading says that the Antional Geographic Society put together a committee which declared that the fact that Peary had reached 
the North Pole is true.In contrast,the professor refuted that this committee was compose of Peary`s friend who has contributed
a lot of money to found this action.What`s more,this investgation only took two days,and the committee was not carefully.
So,the conclusion of the committee is biased.
Second,the reading argus thatthere was another person who used the same equipped and time traveled the same trek,and that can 
prove that peary were able to do it.However,the professer confuted that this person`s condition was different to Peary`s.
He took less food,which means he had much less weight and are more convenient to travel.Besides,the weather condition is very
different from the North Pole.Compared to the hard climate in North Pole,this weather condition is more favorable, and this is why
the person can finish his trek.
Finally,the reading claims that the shadow in Peary`s photograpghs can prove that Peary had reach the North Pole after calculate the sun`s
position according to the shadow.On the other hand,the professer says that it can not confident by the photo.Beacuse this photo was taked 
many years ago,they are freezy and become faded now.But the calaulating of the sun position needs precise measurement of the shadow,
so this photo is not precise and cannot prove this consultion.
