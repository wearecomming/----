First genetically modified trees are able to resistant to some  virus,but that doesn`t necessary ensure their survival
As we know,a typical nonmodified tree  population is genetically diverse,
and that means for some threatening conditions,like poor climate,at least some of the trees are resistant.
so,although some trees die,other resistant trees can survive to ensure the survival of the species.
But the modified trees are all genetically uniform.If there environmental threatening they have not designed,
these trees will all die and the species can not surivie

Second, in the reading ,it says that genetically modified trees can bring a number of economic benefits,
because they can grow faster and give greater yields,which allows farmers to get faster and greater returns.
In contrast,the professor arugs that this cannot bring more money brecuse the increasing of hidden cost.
The seed of this trees will cost more and by law,
